# macOS-lamppEasyInstall 
## This tool will let you install a lampp server on your macOS with super-ease.  
I recently found myself reinstalling the lampp package on my mac as my mac was facing problems and I had to reset it several times.  
This is the .command file and the .sh shell script that you may use for installing the following on your mac:
* Apache2
* php
* mysql  
## chmod +x lamppInstall.*
